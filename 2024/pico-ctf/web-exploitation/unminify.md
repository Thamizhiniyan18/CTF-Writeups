# Unminify

## Challenge Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:63405/), and find the flag!

***

## Solution

The flag is given as the class name to a p tag which is nested deep inside other tags. Expand all tags to  get the flag.

Flag: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}`
