# Collaborative Development

## Challenge Description

My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?

You can download the challenge files here:

## Solution

Download the given file and extract it. You can find .git directory in the given folder, which means git has been initialised. There is file named `flag.py`, which prints `Printing the flag...`.

Since the challenge name is collaborative development, I looked out for other git branches and found three branches. The flag has been broken down into parts, each part is given in each branch.
